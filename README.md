# 👋 Hi, I'm **Abdul Raheem Shahzad**

## Machine Learning Researcher | Medical AI | Deep Learning

Gold Medalist • Published Researcher • Kaggle Silver Medalist • Dataset & Notebook Expert

I am a machine learning researcher passionate about applying deep learning to biological, clinical, and environmental systems. My work combines data-driven modeling with real-world scientific questions in medicine, ecology, and computational biology. I enjoy building models that not only predict outcomes but also help explain the variability inherent in biological systems.

I currently pursue my Master’s degree at Wuhan University while collaborating with Zhongnan Hospital, where I design AI pipelines for predicting IVF and ICSI treatment outcomes. I previously developed a protein-sequence–based leukemia prediction system, which became my first publication in PLOS One and earned the Best Project award in my department.

# 🧠 Research Interests

My research interests sit at the intersection of deep learning, generative AI, and data-driven scientific modeling. I enjoy working on problems where machine learning can help uncover patterns in complex biological, environmental, or clinical systems.

• Generative AI models, including diffusion models, GANs, and flow-based models, for creating or understanding structured scientific data  
• Representation learning for high-dimensional biological or clinical datasets, including protein sequences, medical time series, imaging, and ecological data  
• Deep learning for medical AI and computational biology, inspired by my work in leukemia prediction and IVF/ICSI outcome modeling  
• Climate and environmental modeling using ML, building on my research on groundwater forecasting and ecological niche modeling  
• Sequence modeling with RNNs, Transformers, and hybrid architectures for biological sequences and long-term temporal data  
• Interpretable AI systems that help researchers and clinicians understand predictions instead of treating ML as a black box  
• Cross-domain generalization and transfer learning across scientific datasets, especially in settings with high variability or limited labels  
• Using ML to study heterogeneous populations and capture the underlying factors that drive differences in outcomes or behaviors  

Overall, I am motivated by the idea of using modern deep learning techniques to solve real scientific problems while building models that are explainable, reliable, and grounded in domain understanding.
